    "ideation-panel-initial-state-chromium-linux.png": "This is a screenshot of the 'Ideation' panel. It should have a dark charcoal-black background with a subtle pattern of interconnected lines and dots, resembling a neural network. In the upper-left quadrant of the image, the word 'Ideation' should be clearly visible in a clean, white, sans-serif font."

  "videoDescriptions": {
    "Ideation Panel > should have a parallax effect on mouse movement": "This video should show the 'Ideation' panel, which has a dark background with a static grid. Overlaid on this grid is a dynamic neural network pattern that shifts in the opposite direction of the cursor, creating a parallax effect. The word 'Ideation' in white text should also move with the neural network pattern. The video should start with the panel in a static position. Shortly after, the mouse cursor should appear and move around, demonstrating the parallax effect. The movement should be smooth and directly responsive to the cursor's position. The video should end after demonstrating this effect."
