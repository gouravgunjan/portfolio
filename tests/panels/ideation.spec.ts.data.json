It should have a dark charcoal-black background with a clearly visible, subtle neural network pattern of lines and dots. The word 'Ideation' should be clearly visible in a clean, white, sans-serif font."

    "Ideation Panel > should have a parallax effect on mouse movement": "This video should show the 'Ideation' panel, which has a dark background with an animated neural network. A network of clearly visible lines forms the background, and a small number of dots travel along these lines. The nodes of the network should appear to be fading in and out randomly. The word 'Ideation' in white text should be visible. The test verifies the parallax mouse-over effect. As the cursor moves, the 'Ideation' text and the neural network should subtly shift in the opposite direction of the cursor, creating a parallax effect. The movement should be smooth and directly responsive to the cursor's position. The video should end after demonstrating this effect."
