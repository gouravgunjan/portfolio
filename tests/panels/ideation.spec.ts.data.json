In the upper-left quadrant of the image, the word 'Ideation' should be clearly visible in a clean, white, sans-serif font. There should be no other elements, text, or artifacts visible in the screenshot."

    "Ideation Panel > should have a parallax effect on mouse movement": "This video should show the 'Ideation' panel, which has a dark background and the word 'Ideation' in white text. The test verifies the parallax mouse-over effect. The video should start with the 'Ideation' text in a static position. Shortly after, the mouse cursor should appear and move around the panel. As the cursor moves, the 'Ideation' text should subtly shift in the opposite direction of the cursor, creating a parallax effect. The movement should be smooth and directly responsive to the cursor's position. The video should end after demonstrating this effect."
