# Portfolio Storyboard

## Panel 1: Ideation

*   **Title:** Ideation Phase
*   **Aesthetics:**
    *   **Background:** A dark, ethereal space (e.g., `#0A0A10`), suggesting limitless possibility.
    *   **Color Palette:** Soft, glowing neons for the floating elements.
    *   **Effects:** Gentle, slow-drifting motion for all elements. A subtle parallax effect on mouse movement to create depth. Elements should have a soft bloom/glow.
*   **Visual:** A stunning, cinematic opening visual representing the "Ideation Phase."
*   **On-Screen Elements:**
    1.  **Floating Abstract Elements:**
        *   **Lines:** Long, thin, ethereal lines of light that drift and gently bend as if underwater. They should vary in length and thickness.
        *   **Panels:** Semi-transparent, glowing rectangular panels that fade in and out, suggesting nascent UI containers.
        *   **Alphabetic Characters:** Individual letters from "Gourav Gunjan" and "Creative UI Developer" float separately before assembling. They have a soft, pulsating glow.
        *   **Clouds:** Wispy, nebula-like clouds made of fine particles that drift slowly across the screen, adding depth.
        *   **UI Sketches:** Faint, hand-drawn style sketches of UI components (buttons, sliders, cards) that appear and disappear like fleeting thoughts.
        *   **Logos:** Subtle, monochrome versions of company logos (Google, VMware, etc.) drift in the background, foreshadowing later panels.
    2.  **Text:** "Gourav Gunjan" and "Creative UI Developer." The text should not be static but should subtly drift and have a soft glow.

*   **Morphing to Panel 2 (The Blueprint):**
    *   The floating abstract lines will begin to align and straighten, eventually forming the glowing grid of the blueprint.
    *   The alphabetic characters will coalesce and animate to form the title text of the next panel.
    *   The drifting clouds and UI sketches will fade away as the blueprint grid becomes more defined.
    *   The background will transition from the ethereal space to the structured blueprint grid.
