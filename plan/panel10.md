# Panel 10: Get in Touch - Development Plan

## 1. Component and Asset Structure

-   [ ] Create a new component file: `src/components/panels/GetInTouch.tsx`
-   [ ] Create a new module SCSS file: `src/components/panels/GetInTouch.module.scss`
-   [ ] Create a dedicated asset folder: `src/assets/panels/getintouch/`

## 2. Background and Content

-   [ ] Reuse the dark, ethereal background from Panel 1, but with calmer, slower-moving particles.
-   [ ] Create a prominent "Get in Touch" or "Say Hello" button with a glowing neon border.
-   [ ] Create social media icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, etc., with a neon glow and a subtle animation on hover.
-   [ ] Write an E2E test to verify the hover animations.
-   [ ] Commit changes with message: `feat(panel-10): implement background and content`

## 3. Final Animation

-   [ ] Implement the social media icons and the email button drifting slowly.
-   [ ] Implement the background particles swirling and coalescing into a final, elegant logo or signature.
-   [ ] Write an E2E test to verify the final animation.
-   [ ] Commit changes with message: `feat(panel-10): implement final animation`
